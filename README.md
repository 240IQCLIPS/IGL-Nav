We propose **IGL-Nav**, an Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization framework that builds a 3D scene representation during exploration and performs coarse-to-fine localization of image goals using 3D convolution and differentiable rendering. IGL-Nav achieves strong performance on both simulation benchmarks and real-world deployment.
